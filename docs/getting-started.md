# Getting Started with Prizm

Welcome to Prizm - the adaptive specification framework for AI-assisted development! This guide will help you understand Prizm's approach and get started with your first project.

## What is Prizm?

Prizm is a specification framework that grows with your project complexity. It provides:

- **Core Trinity**: Essential files every project needs (requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md)
- **Extended Steering Documents**: Optional files that scale with project complexity
- **AI-Optimized Structure**: Designed for seamless AI assistant integration
- **Progressive Complexity**: Start simple, add complexity as needed

## Getting Templates

Prizm is a specification framework - copy the templates you need:

```bash
# Clone or download the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/prizm.git

# Copy templates to your project
cp prizm/spec/core/*.md your-project/
```

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Choose Your Templates

Select the appropriate template set for your project complexity:

```bash
# Simple project (Core Trinity only)
cp spec/core/*.md my-project/

# Web API project (add essential extended docs)
cp spec/core/*.md my-project/
cp spec/extended/style.md my-project/
cp spec/extended/testing-strategy.md my-project/

# SaaS application (add comprehensive docs)
cp spec/core/*.md my-project/
cp spec/extended/{style,domain,constraints,testing-strategy,integrations,security}.md my-project/

# Enterprise (full documentation suite)
cp -r spec/ my-project/
```

### Step 2: Customize Your Project

Navigate to your project and customize the generated files:

```bash
cd my-project
ls -la  # See the generated specification files
```

**Project complexity levels:**
```
simple-cli     â†’ Core Trinity only
web-api        â†’ Core Trinity + 3 extended docs
saas-app       â†’ Core Trinity + 6 extended docs  
microservices  â†’ Core Trinity + 11 extended docs
```

### Step 3: Fill Out the Core Trinity

Start with these three essential files:

#### 1. requirements.md
Define what your project needs to accomplish:
```markdown
# Requirements Document

## REQ-001: User Authentication
**User Story:** As a user, I want to log in securely...
**Priority:** High
**Complexity:** Medium

### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a user enters valid credentials THEN they are authenticated
2. WHEN authentication fails THEN clear error messages are shown
```

#### 2. design.md
Outline your technical approach:
```markdown
# Design Document

## Architecture Overview
- Frontend: React with TypeScript
- Backend: Node.js with Express
- Database: PostgreSQL

## API Design
- RESTful endpoints
- JWT authentication
- Input validation
```

#### 3. tasks.md
Plan your development work:
```markdown
# Tasks Document

## Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
**TASK-001: Setup Development Environment**
- Priority: High
- Dependencies: None
```

### Step 4: Review and Refine

Validate your specifications manually or with your preferred tools:

```bash
# Review specifications for completeness
# - Are requirements clear and testable?
# - Does design address all requirements?
# - Are tasks specific and actionable?

# Use any validation tools you prefer:
# - Markdown linters
# - Custom scripts
# - Manual review processes
```

### Step 5: Work with Your AI Assistant

Prizm files are designed to work seamlessly with AI assistants:

```
ðŸ¤– "Based on these requirements, implement the authentication system"
ðŸ¤– "Update the design document with the new API endpoints"
ðŸ¤– "Create tasks for implementing the user dashboard"
```

## Template Reference

### Core Templates

- **`spec/core/requirements.md`** - What to build (user stories, features)
- **`spec/core/design.md`** - How to build it (architecture, technical approach)
- **`spec/core/tasks.md`** - When to build it (planning, timeline)

### Extended Templates

- **`spec/extended/style.md`** - Coding standards and conventions
- **`spec/extended/testing-strategy.md`** - Testing approach and quality
- **`spec/extended/integrations.md`** - External service integrations
- **`spec/extended/domain.md`** - Business logic and domain modeling

## Working with AI Assistants

### AI Assistant Integration

Prizm works especially well with AI assistants:

```
# Example prompts
"Help me implement the user authentication based on requirements.md"
"Review the design.md and suggest improvements"
"Create the next development tasks based on current progress"
```

### Other AI Assistants

Prizm also works with:
- **GitHub Copilot**: Use spec files for context
