# Best Practices Guide

This guide provides proven patterns, approaches, and lessons learned from successful Prizm implementations across different project types and team sizes.

## Core Principles

### Specification-First Development
- **Define Before Building**: Always start with clear specifications
- **Living Documentation**: Keep specifications current with code
- **Single Source of Truth**: Use specifications to resolve disagreements
- **Gradual Evolution**: Allow specifications to evolve with understanding

### Progressive Complexity
- **Start Simple**: Begin with Core Trinity, add complexity as needed
- **Organic Growth**: Add extended documents when specific needs arise
- **Avoid Over-Engineering**: Don't create documentation for its own sake
- **Pragmatic Approach**: Focus on value delivery over documentation perfection

### AI-Optimized Structure
- **Context-Rich**: Provide comprehensive context for AI assistants
- **Structured Data**: Use consistent formatting for AI parsing
- **Actionable Information**: Include specific, implementable guidance
- **Iterative Refinement**: Continuously improve AI integration patterns

## Document Quality Standards

### Writing Excellence

#### Clear and Concise Language
```markdown
# ✅ Good - Specific and actionable
**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to assign tasks to team members so that work is distributed efficiently and accountability is clear.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN I select a task THEN I see a dropdown of available team members
2. WHEN I assign a task THEN the assignee receives a notification
3. WHEN I view the task THEN I can see who is assigned and when

# ❌ Bad - Vague and unclear
**User Story:** The system should have task assignment.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Tasks can be assigned
- People get notified
- Assignment is tracked
```

#### Structured Information
```markdown
# ✅ Good - Well-structured with clear sections
## REQ-001: User Authentication

**Priority:** High
**Complexity:** Medium
**Dependencies:** None

### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a user provides valid credentials THEN they are authenticated
2. WHEN credentials are invalid THEN clear error messages are shown

### Business Rules
- Passwords must be at least 8 characters
- Account lockout after 5 failed attempts
- Session timeout after 24 hours

### Edge Cases
- Password reset via email verification
- Concurrent login handling
- Account recovery procedures

# ❌ Bad - Unstructured information
User authentication: Users need to log in. Passwords should be secure. Handle errors properly.
```

#### Actionable Content
```markdown
# ✅ Good - Specific implementation guidance
## Technology Stack

### Backend Framework
- **Choice:** Express.js 4.18+
- **Rationale:** Team expertise, proven scalability, rich ecosystem
- **Alternatives Considered:** Fastify (performance), Koa (simplicity)
- **Configuration:** TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier

### Database
- **Choice:** PostgreSQL 14+
- **Rationale:** ACID compliance, JSON support, performance
- **Schema:** User table with UUID primary keys
- **Migrations:** Use node-pg-migrate for schema changes

# ❌ Bad - Vague technology choices
We'll use Node.js for backend and some database. Express is probably good.
```

### Consistency Standards

#### Document Structure
```markdown
# Consistent document headers
# [Document Type] - [Project Name]

## Overview
Brief description of document purpose

## [Main Content Sections]
Structured information relevant to document type

## [Supporting Information]
Additional context, examples, references

---
**Document Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** [Date]
**Owner:** [Role/Team]
**Next Review:** [Date]
```

#### Naming Conventions
```markdown
# File naming
requirements.md        # Core trinity files
design.md             # Lowercase, descriptive
tasks.md              # Consistent naming

# Requirement IDs
REQ-001               # Requirements
TASK-001              # Tasks
ARCH-001              # Architecture decisions

# Version control
feat: add user auth requirements (REQ-001)
docs: update design.md with new architecture
fix: correct task estimates in tasks.md
```

## Implementation Patterns

### Project Initialization

#### Choosing the Right Starting Point
```bash
# Simple project (1-2 people, 2-4 weeks)
cp -r prizm/templates/core/* project/spec/
# Add: requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md

# Medium project (3-5 people, 1-3 months)
cp -r prizm/examples/web-api/spec/* project/spec/
# Add: Core Trinity + style.md, testing-strategy.md, integrations.md

# Complex project (5+ people, 3+ months)
cp -r prizm/examples/saas-app/spec/* project/spec/
# Add: Core Trinity + 6 extended documents

# Enterprise project (10+ people, 6+ months)
cp -r prizm/examples/microservices/spec/* project/spec/
# Add: Core Trinity + 11 extended documents
```

#### Customization Strategy
```bash
# 1. Start with appropriate template
cp -r prizm/examples/web-api/spec/* project/spec/

# 2. Customize requirements
# - Update project name and description
# - Replace example requirements with your needs
# - Adjust acceptance criteria for your context

# 3. Adapt design
