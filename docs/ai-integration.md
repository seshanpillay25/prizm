## AI Assistant Platforms

### Claude Code (Recommended)

#### Why Claude Code Works Best with Prizm
- **File-aware**: Can read and reference multiple specification files
- **Context-aware**: Understands project structure and relationships
- **Code-focused**: Optimized for software development tasks
- **Iterative**: Maintains context across development sessions

#### Setting Up with Prizm Templates
```bash
# Copy template to initialize project
cp -r spec/examples/saas-app/* my-project/

# Work with Claude Code on the specification templates
claude-code "Review these specification templates and customize for our project"
claude-code "Based on requirements.md, implement the authentication system"
```

#### Basic Usage Patterns
```bash
# Reference specific requirements
"Based on REQ-001 in requirements.md, implement the user authentication system"

# Update specifications  
"Update the design.md to reflect the new microservices architecture"

# Generate tasks
"Create development tasks for the payment system based on requirements.md"

# Review code against specs
"Review this API implementation against the design patterns in design.md"

# Validate and improve specs
"Review our specifications for consistency and completeness, identify any issues"
```

#### Advanced Patterns
```bash
# Multi-file analysis
"Analyze requirements.md, design.md, and constraints.md to recommend the best database architecture"

# Cross-reference validation
"Check if the current authentication implementation matches both the security requirements and the style guide"

# Specification-driven refactoring
"Refactor this code to follow the patterns in style.md and update design.md if needed"
```

## AI-Assisted Workflow with Prizm CLI

```

### GitHub Copilot

#### Integration Strategy
- **Context Files**: Keep specification files open while coding
- **Comment-driven**: Use specification excerpts in code comments
- **Iterative Development**: Reference specs in variable names and functions

#### Usage Patterns
```javascript
// Based on REQ-001: User authentication with JWT tokens
// Implementation should follow security.md guidelines
const authenticateUser = async (credentials) => {
  // Copilot will suggest implementation based on context
}

// From design.md: Use repository pattern for data access
class UserRepository {
  // Copilot suggests methods based on design patterns
}
```

### Cursor IDE

#### Setup
1. **Workspace Configuration**: Include spec files in workspace
2. **Context Rules**: Configure Cursor to reference specification files
3. **Custom Prompts**: Create prompts that reference specific documents

#### Usage Patterns
```
// Select code and use Cursor's "Fix with AI"
// Prompt: "Fix this code to follow the patterns in style.md"

// Use Cursor's "Generate" feature
// Prompt: "Generate API endpoints based on the requirements in requirements.md"

// Code explanation with context
// Prompt: "Explain how this code implements REQ-003 from requirements.md"
```

## AI Integration Best Practices

### Prompt Engineering

#### Effective Prompt Structure
```
Context: [Reference specific specification files]
Task: [Clearly state what you want the AI to do]
Constraints: [Mention any limitations or requirements]
Output: [Specify the desired format or type of response]

Example:
"Context: Based on REQ-001 in requirements.md and the security patterns in security.md
Task: Implement JWT authentication middleware
Constraints: Must follow the error handling patterns in style.md
Output: Complete TypeScript implementation with tests"
```

#### Specification Referencing
```bash
# ✅ Good - Specific references
"Based on REQ-001 in requirements.md, implement the user authentication system"

# ❌ Bad - Vague references
"Implement authentication"

# ✅ Good - Multi-file context
"Using the architecture in design.md and the constraints in constraints.md, design the database schema"

# ❌ Bad - No context
"Design a database schema"
```

### Context Management

#### File Organization for AI
```
project/
├── spec/                    # Keep all specs in one directory
│   ├── requirements.md     # AI can easily reference
│   ├── design.md          # Clear file structure
│   ├── tasks.md           # Predictable locations
│   └── style.md           # Consistent naming
├── src/                    # Source code
└── docs/                   # Additional documentation
```

#### Context Sharing Strategies
```bash
# Share specific sections
claude-code "Based on this requirement: [paste REQ-001 from requirements.md]"

# Share multiple related sections
claude-code "Given these constraints: [paste relevant constraints] and this design: [paste architecture section]"

# Reference entire files when needed
claude-code "Based on the complete requirements.md file, generate a comprehensive test plan"
```

### Quality Assurance with AI

#### Validation Patterns
```bash
# Requirement validation
claude-code "Validate this implementation against the acceptance criteria in REQ-001"

# Design validation
claude-code "Check if this code follows the architecture patterns in design.md"

# Style validation
claude-code "Review this code for compliance with the style guide"

# Test validation
claude-code "Evaluate the test coverage against the testing strategy"
```

#### Error Prevention
```bash
# Pre-implementation validation
claude-code "Before implementing, check if this approach aligns with the constraints in constraints.md"

# Integration validation
claude-code "Validate this integration against the patterns in integrations.md"

# Security validation
