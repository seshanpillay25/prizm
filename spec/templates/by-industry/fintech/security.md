## Data Classification & Protection

### Data Classification Levels

#### Level 1: Public
- Marketing materials
- General product information
- Public API documentation

#### Level 2: Internal
- System logs (sanitized)
- Performance metrics
- General business data

#### Level 3: Confidential
- User account information
- Transaction metadata
- Internal business processes

#### Level 4: Restricted/PII
- Personal identifiable information
- Financial account details
- Authentication credentials
- Payment card data (PCI DSS scope)

#### Level 5: Highly Sensitive
- Account numbers and routing numbers
- Social Security Numbers
- Payment card data (PAN, CVV)
- Biometric data
- Cryptographic keys

### Data Protection by Classification

```
Level 1 (Public):     No encryption required
Level 2 (Internal):   TLS in transit
Level 3 (Confidential): TLS in transit + AES-256 at rest
Level 4 (PII):        TLS in transit + AES-256 at rest + Field-level encryption
Level 5 (Sensitive):  TLS in transit + AES-256 at rest + HSM key management
```

## Encryption Standards

### Encryption at Rest
- **Algorithm**: AES-256-GCM
- **Key Management**: Hardware Security Module (HSM)
- **Database**: Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)
- **File Storage**: Server-side encryption with customer-managed keys
- **Backup**: Encrypted backups with separate key management

### Encryption in Transit
- **External Communications**: TLS 1.3 minimum
- **Internal Communications**: mTLS (mutual TLS)
- **Database Connections**: TLS 1.2+ with certificate validation
- **Message Queues**: TLS with client certificates
- **API Calls**: HTTPS with HSTS headers

### Field-Level Encryption
```sql
-- Example for PII data
CREATE TABLE users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  email_encrypted BYTEA,  -- Encrypted email
  phone_encrypted BYTEA,  -- Encrypted phone
  ssn_encrypted BYTEA,    -- Encrypted SSN
  encryption_key_id VARCHAR(255),
  created_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Key Management Strategy
- **HSM Integration**: AWS CloudHSM or Azure Dedicated HSM
- **Key Rotation**: Automated monthly rotation
- **Key Escrow**: Secure key backup for disaster recovery
- **Access Control**: Multi-person authorization for key operations
- **Audit Trail**: Complete key lifecycle logging

## Identity & Access Management

### Authentication Requirements

#### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
```
Primary Factor:    Password or PIN
Secondary Factor:  SMS OTP, TOTP, Push notification, Biometric
Backup Factor:     Recovery codes, Hardware tokens
```

#### Biometric Authentication
- **Supported Types**: Fingerprint, Face ID, Voice recognition
- **Storage**: Biometric templates encrypted and stored locally
- **Fallback**: PIN/password fallback required
- **Privacy**: No raw biometric data transmission

#### Adaptive Authentication
```javascript
// Risk scoring example
const riskFactors = {
  newDevice: +20,
  foreignCountry: +30,
  suspiciousIP: +40,
  unusualTime: +15,
  velocityCheck: +25,
  behaviorAnomaly: +35
};

if (totalRiskScore > 50) {
  requireStepUpAuthentication();
}
```

### Authorization Framework

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
```
Roles:
├── Customer
│   ├── Basic User (view accounts, basic transactions)
│   ├── Premium User (advanced features, higher limits)
│   └── Business User (business account management)
├── Employee
│   ├── Customer Service (view customer data, basic operations)
│   ├── Manager (approve transactions, manage limits)
│   └── Administrator (system configuration)
└── System
    ├── API Service (inter-service communication)
    └── Audit Service (read-only access to all data)
```

#### Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)
```javascript
// Example policy
{
  "effect": "Allow",
  "subject": "user:123",
  "action": "transfer:create",
  "resource": "account:456",
  "conditions": {
    "amount": {"$lt": 10000},
    "time": {"$between": ["09:00", "17:00"]},
    "location": {"$in": ["US", "CA"]}
  }
}
```

## Fraud Detection & Prevention

### Real-Time Fraud Scoring

#### Fraud Detection Rules
```javascript
const fraudRules = [
  {
    name: "velocity_check",
    condition: "transaction_count > 10 in 1 hour",
    score: 40,
    action: "review"
  },
  {
    name: "amount_anomaly", 
    condition: "amount > 3 * avg_monthly_spending",
    score: 60,
    action: "block"
  },
  {
    name: "geographic_anomaly",
    condition: "distance_from_last_transaction > 500 miles",
    score: 50,
    action: "mfa_required"
  }
];
```

#### Machine Learning Models
- **Supervised Learning**: Transaction classification (fraud/legitimate)
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Anomaly detection for unusual patterns
- **Real-time Scoring**: Sub-100ms fraud score calculation
- **Model Updates**: Weekly model retraining with new fraud patterns

### Transaction Monitoring

#### Suspicious Activity Indicators
- Large cash transactions (>$10,000)
- Rapid succession of transactions
- Round number transactions
- Transactions to high-risk countries
- Unusual transaction patterns
- Multiple failed authentication attempts

#### Automated Response Actions
```
Risk Score 0-30:    Allow transaction, log for analysis
Risk Score 31-60:   Require additional authentication
Risk Score 61-80:   Hold for manual review
Risk Score 81-100:  Block transaction, alert security team
```

## Network Security

### Web Application Firewall (WAF)
```yaml
# Example WAF rules
rules:
  - name: "SQL Injection Protection"
    pattern: "/(union|select|insert|delete|update).*from/i"
    action: "block"
    
  - name: "Rate Limiting"
    condition: "requests > 1000 per minute"
    action: "throttle"
    
  - name: "Geographic Blocking"
    condition: "country_code in ['XX', 'YY']"  # High-risk countries
    action: "block"
```

### DDoS Protection
- **Cloudflare/AWS Shield**: Application-layer protection
- **Rate Limiting**: Per-IP and per-user limits
- **Traffic Analysis**: Real-time traffic pattern monitoring
- **Geo-blocking**: Block traffic from high-risk regions

### Network Segmentation
```
DMZ Network:        Load balancers, WAF
Application Tier:   API servers, application servers
Database Tier:      Database servers, cache servers
Management Tier:    Monitoring, logging, backup systems
```

## Application Security

### Secure Development Lifecycle (SDLC)

#### Security Requirements
- Threat modeling for all new features

    type: 'number',
    minimum: 0.01,
    maximum: 50000,
    multipleOf: 0.01
  },
  recipient: {
    type: 'string',
    pattern: '^[a-zA-Z0-9-]+$',
    maxLength: 50
  }
};
```

  sub: 'user:123',
  iat: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000),
  exp: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + (60 * 15), // 15 minutes
  scope: ['read:accounts', 'write:transactions'],
  aud: 'fintech-api',
  iss: 'auth.fintech.com'
};
```

#### API Rate Limiting
```
Endpoint-specific limits:
- GET /accounts: 100 requests/minute
- POST /transactions: 10 requests/minute  
- POST /auth/login: 5 requests/minute
- POST /password/reset: 2 requests/hour
```

#### API Security Headers

X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
```
