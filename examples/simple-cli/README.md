# Simple CLI Example - Todo List Application

This example demonstrates how to use the Prizm Core Trinity (requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md) for a simple command-line application project.

## Quick Start

To create a similar project using Prizm templates:

```bash
# Copy the core trinity templates
cp spec/core/*.md your-todo-project/

# Customize the specifications for your needs
# - Update requirements.md with your features
# - Adapt design.md for your architecture  
# - Plan tasks.md for your timeline
```

## Project Overview

**Todo CLI** is a command-line task management application that showcases:
- How to structure requirements for a simple, focused project
- Technical design for a single-process CLI application
- Task breakdown for a solo developer project

## Why This Example?\n\nThis example is perfect for:\n- **Solo developers** working on personal projects\n- **Learning** how to apply Prizm to small-scale applications\n- **Weekend projects** that need clear structure\n- **Command-line tools** and utilities\n\n## Prizm Files Included\n\n### üìã [requirements.md](spec/requirements.md)\n- **5 core requirements** covering the essential functionality\n- **User stories** in simple, actionable format\n- **Acceptance criteria** that are easy to test\n- **Non-functional requirements** for performance and usability\n- **Clear scope definition** with what's included and excluded\n\n**Key Features Specified:**\n- Add tasks to a todo list\n- List tasks with filtering options\n- Mark tasks as complete\n- Remove tasks with confirmation\n- Display task statistics\n\n### üèóÔ∏è [design.md](spec/design.md)\n- **Simple architecture** with file-based storage\n- **Component breakdown** for a modular CLI application\n- **Data models** using JSON for persistence\n- **Command specifications** with usage examples\n- **Error handling** strategy\n- **Testing approach** with unit and integration tests\n\n**Technical Decisions:**\n- Node.js for cross-platform compatibility\n- JSON file storage for simplicity\n- Commander.js for CLI parsing\n- Jest for testing\n\n### ‚úÖ [tasks.md](spec/tasks.md)\n- **5 phases** of development from setup to release\n- **20+ specific tasks** with time estimates\n- **Clear dependencies** between tasks\n- **Definition of done** for each task\n- **Risk management** for potential issues\n- **Quality gates** to ensure delivery standards\n\n**Development Flow:**\n1. **Foundation**: Project setup and storage system\n2. **Core Features**: Task management and CLI interface\n3. **User Experience**: Output formatting and configuration\n4. **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite\n5. **Release**: Documentation and distribution\n\n## What This Example Demonstrates\n\n### ‚ú® Prizm Core Trinity in Action\n\n**Requirements ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Tasks Flow:**\n1. **Requirements** define WHAT needs to be built\n2. **Design** defines HOW it will be built\n3. **Tasks** define WHEN and WHO will build it\n\n### üéØ Focused Scope\n\nNotice how the requirements clearly define what's **included** and **excluded**:\n- ‚úÖ Basic task management\n- ‚úÖ Command-line interface\n- ‚úÖ Local file storage\n- ‚ùå Task scheduling\n- ‚ùå Multi-user support\n- ‚ùå Web interface\n\n### üîß Practical Design Decisions\n\nThe design document shows real-world technical choices:\n- **File-based storage** instead of database for simplicity\n- **JSON format** for human-readable data\n- **Commander.js** for robust CLI parsing\n- **Cross-platform** considerations\n\n### üìä Realistic Task Planning\n\nThe tasks are broken down with:\n- **Specific time estimates** (2-5 hours per task)\n- **Clear dependencies** between tasks\n- **Risk identification** and mitigation\n- **Quality gates** for each phase\n\n## How to Use This Example\n\n### 1. Study the Structure\n\nRead through the three files to understand:\n- How requirements flow into design decisions\n- How design decisions inform task planning\n- How tasks reference back to requirements\n\n### 2. Apply to Your Project\n\nUse this as a template for similar projects:\n- **CLI tools** and utilities\n- **Personal productivity** applications\n- **Simple web services** (adapt the architecture)\n- **Weekend projects** with clear scope\n\n### 3. Customize for Your Needs\n\nModify the structure for your context:\n- **Add more requirements** for complex features\n- **Adjust the architecture** for different technologies\n- **Scale the tasks** for team projects\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n### üöÄ Start Simple\n\nThis example shows how Prizm works even for simple projects:\n- **5 requirements** cover the core functionality\n- **Clear architecture** without over-engineering\n- **Manageable tasks** for a solo developer\n\n### üìù Document Decisions\n\nEven simple projects benefit from documentation:\n- **Why** certain technical choices were made\n- **How** the system should behave\n- **What** needs to be built in what order\n\n### üîÑ Iterate and Improve\n\nThe specifications are living documents:\n- **Update** as requirements change\n- **Refine** as design evolves\n- **Adjust** tasks based on progress\n\n## Next Steps\n\nAfter studying this example:\n\n1. **Try it yourself**: Use these specs to actually build the Todo CLI\n2. **Adapt for your project**: Modify the structure for your own CLI tool\n3. **Explore more examples**: Check out the [web-api](../web-api/) and [saas-app](../saas-app/) examples\n4. **Learn more**: Read the [Prizm documentation](../../docs/) for advanced patterns\n\n## Questions?\n\nThis example demonstrates the **Core Trinity** approach.
